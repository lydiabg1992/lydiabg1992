### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lydia Burrage-Goodwin and I am a motivated junior front-end engineer based on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. 

My goal is to find an institution with a good purpose that will allow me to share my skillset while helping me grow as a burgeoning front-end developer. 

 ~ In 2023, I graduated from Simmons University in Boston, MA with my Master's in Library and Information Science. I took web design and development courses throughout my degree, and recently (July 2023) completed a semester-long internship with the Boston College O'Neill Library Systems and Applications Team, where I built a new arrivals page for the university. 

 ~ While earning my Masters' degree, I taught in the public schools as a middle school substitute, and at a private school as an orchestra assistant for their afterschool strings program. 

 ~ I am primarily focusing my time and energies into upskilling my technological toolkit as a front-end developer. I have spent this summer completing an intensive course in Front-End Engineering on Codecademy, and earned a professional certificate in September 2023.
